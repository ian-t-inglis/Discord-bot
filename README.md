# Discord-bot
This Discord bot is built using the [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library. 
It currently only supports commands and responding to messages with in-built Discord functions. However, further packages and iterations can and will add more functionality. 
The bot has had the token removed, so if you wish to copy this Python script, change a few things, and throw your own token in there to spice up your server and have fun, then by all means go ahead :D!
